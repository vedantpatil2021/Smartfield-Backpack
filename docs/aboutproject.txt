Smart Backpack System for Animal Ecology: Field-Deployable Multimodal Data Infrastructure

We have developed a field-deployable Smart Backpack system that addresses critical data acquisition challenges in animal ecology research. The system integrates multimodal sensing capabilities with edge computing infrastructure, enabling real-time data capture, processing, and storage across heterogeneous network environments. Traditional animal ecology fieldwork confronts fundamental operational constraints: manual data collection protocols introduce systematic quality degradation, remote study sites operate beyond conventional network infrastructure precluding real-time monitoring, existing sensing systems remain predominantly single-modal requiring multiple independent hardware deployments, and post-fieldwork data processing paradigms inherently sacrifice temporal resolution. Current methodologies rely on human-operated data collection cycles with continuous field personnel deployment, demanding repeated battery replacement, manual sensor maintenance, and physical data retrieval—creating vulnerability to data corruption, storage limitations, and operational discontinuity. The Smart Backpack integrates heterogeneous hardware components into a unified autonomous monitoring framework comprising edge computing devices, distributed power management systems, wireless mesh networking, Raspberry Pi processing nodes, and drone-based platforms establishing dual-perspective observational capacity. Software architecture implements three interconnected modules: Camera-trap executes edge-based machine learning inference for real-time animal detection utilizing motion-triggered image capture with threshold-based classification scoring; WildWing, an open-source autonomous UAS platform, enables animal behavior video monitoring; and OpenPassLite coordinates autonomous drone deployment to triggered camera-trap locations for 40-50 second behavioral observation cycles. The system orchestrates a comprehensive detection-to-documentation pipeline generating synchronized multimodal datasets—ground-level camera-trap imagery paired with aerial drone videography—providing complementary observational perspectives without human intervention. The integrated system underwent 20 hours of rigorous field testing, validating autonomous operation across complete detection-deployment-recovery cycles under operational field conditions.
